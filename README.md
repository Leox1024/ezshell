#### This project is still under development (WIP). It is simply a shell that connects to multiple hosts via SSH and allows you to run a single command on all connected clients at the same time.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Leox1024/ezshell && cd ezshell && chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```
